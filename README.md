# firstattempt
first attempt at creating a repo.  now i get it - this is where I put in a description of the project.
Firstattempt is a menu driven internet radio station player.  a menu of 7 music genres is presented as choices to listen to, with the eighth choice being one to exit the program.
As a user selects a genre choice (integer) a python program is run which uses the integer as variable to call up a list of internet radio stations based on the genre, and a randomly selected internet radio station is chosen from the list and is played using mpg123.
About as simple as you can imagine.
